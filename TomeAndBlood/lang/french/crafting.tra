(Invocation/Evocation)

Level: 1
Range: Special
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is the Wild Mage's ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the Mage releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process.

To use Nahal's Reckless Dweomer simply cast it, then choose from your list of known spells. A burst of magical energy is released, which the Wild Mage will try to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is determined randomly by a dice roll on the Wild Surge Table (see the manual for more details).

Because the release of energy is planned by the Mage, <PRO_HISHER> level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the Mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result might be beneficial to the Mage, or it might be completely disastrous: This is the risk the Mage takes in casting Nahal's Reckless Dweomer.~

@115119 =  ~This deadly wand was crafted by the wizard Hegthen to protect him from his rival's fire-using minions. Hegthen made frequent use of the wand during his protracted war with his enemy. After ten years of hounding, Hegthen decided to take the battle to his rival, defeating him in one of the most spectacular magical duels ever seen in Suzail's history. As his terms of victory, Hethgen demanded that his enemy's name be magically snuffed out of the memory of all who knew him. His enemy accepted and later went on to become the Cloaked Flame, a dangerous terrorist killed by Cormyrean Purple Dragons and War Wizards in 1212 DR.
